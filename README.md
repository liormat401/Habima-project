## Overview
As the Habima Theater became a part of the municipal corporation, a significant shift occurred in the payment system for employees within the technical departments. This transition moved away from hourly contracts to adopt a Task-Based Payment Method, The new method led to significant changes in the theater's work processes, starting from weekly work schedules to salary calculations.

## My Role
As the COO Assistant at the theater, my primary responsibility was to develop a solution that would enable the implementation of the task-based method.

## The Task-Based Method
The Task-Based Payment Method introduced several key features:

### Task Assignment
Tasks were assigned to employees within the weekly work schedules. When an employee completed multiple tasks consecutively on the same day, they became eligible for a percentage increase over the base task value, capped at 200%. 

Example:
- Base Task Value: $100
- First Task: 100% of base
- Second Task: 20% of base
- Third Task: 20% of base
- Fourth Task: 60% of base

Four tasks in a row on the same day would result in a total payment of $200 for that day.

### Gap Between Tasks
If there was a significant time gap between two assigned tasks, the second task would not receive a 20% increase but would be treated as a new task, starting at 100% of the base task value.

Example:
- 8 am: Set construction (4 hours of work)
- 18 pm: Play

For that day, the payment would be 100% + 100%.

### Extra Pay
Employees received additional compensation as mandated by law for night shifts or holidays, which amounted to a 50% increase. This required the recording of clock-in and clock-out times.

### Distance-Based Pay
Tasks also included extra pay based on the distance from the theater, particularly for performances held outside the theater, which could occur anywhere in Israel.

### Base Task Value
The base task value was determined by an employee's seniority within the organization.

This GitHub project aims to provide insights into the transition to the Task-Based Payment Method and the associated changes in operational procedures at Habima Theater.
